## 📖 About Project  
CerebraRAGLink is an AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with integrated graph intelligence.  
It combines vector similarity search with relationship mapping to deliver precise and context-aware responses.  
The system ingests documents, generates embeddings, stores them in a vector database, and leverages graph linking for deeper context discovery.  

Key capabilities include:  
- High-performance vector storage & search using PostgreSQL + pgvector  
- Graph-based linking between entities, queries, and knowledge nodes  
- Automatic query-to-database mapping with contextual updates  
- Support for claims processing and master data integration

## 📝 Important Notes  
- This repository is currently **private** and will be open-sourced after the first stable release.  
- API designs and database schemas may change during development.  
- Planned integrations include Cerebras API for LLMs and advanced graph-based retrieval.  
- The goal is to provide both **API-first** and **graph-visualization** interfaces for enterprise knowledge systems.
