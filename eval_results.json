Clicking it changes the patient's status from 'waiting' to 'skipped' on the list, which removes their name from the active queue display system outside the doctor's room[cite: 148, 149]. This helps manage patient flow for those who are present[cite: 150]. However, despite the 'skipped' status, the doctor retains the full ability to select that patient and record a prescription for them if they arrive later[cite: 151].",
    "answer": "The Skip button on the OPD Doctor Desk list is used to move a patient out of the active waiting queue. When a doctor clicks Skip, the patient\u2019s status changes from \u201cwaiting\u201d to \u201cskipped,\u201d which removes the patient\u2019s name from the queue display and automatically advances the list to the next patient.

It verifies the current stock of those specific drugs, marking available ones in green and unavailable ones in red[cite: 450]. The 'Drugs Toggle' button is a proactive filter used during the search process itself; doctors can select 'Show Available' to only search for drugs that are in stock[cite: 457, 458]. Together, these tools help doctors avoid prescribing out-of-stock medication, ensuring the patient can receive what is prescribed[cite: 461].",

This central repository allows doctors to view uploaded PDFs alongside other clinical information, supporting a complete and up\u2011to\u2011date view of the patient\u2019s history. By having documents available in the EMR, clinicians can more easily review past examinations, advice, and other details during an OPD consultation, which improves the efficiency and accuracy of care.",

    "question": "Why does the OPD module restrict prescription saving without complaints and diagnosis?",
    "expected": "Chief complaints and diagnoses are mandatory fields for saving prescriptions. This prevents incomplete records and ensures that each prescription is clinically justified. The rule enforces good medical practice and ensures accountability in patient care.",
    "answer": "The OPD module requires the Chief Complaints and Diagnosis fields to be filled before a prescription can be saved because these entries are mandatory for completing a prescription record. This ensures that every prescription is linked to a documented clinical reason and a confirmed diagnosis, providing a clear justification for the medicines prescribed. By enforcing these fields, the system helps maintain accurate patient records, supports clinical accountability, and prevents incomplete or unsupported prescriptions from being stored.

    "question": "How does the system allow doctors to mark confidential information in a diagnosis?",
    "expected": "The diagnosis tab provides a section for confidential notes visible only to doctors. These notes are excluded from the patient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s printed prescription but remain part of the medical record. This ensures sensitive information is securely documented without compromising patient trust.",
    "answer": "The system provides a \u201cConfidential Info\u201d button on the diagnosis entry screen. When a doctor clicks this button, a tab expands with a text box where confidential details can be entered and saved. This information is stored as part of the diagnosis but is visible only to doctors and is excluded from the printed prescription. The confidential note can be added alongside the regular diagnosis entry before the doctor clicks the \u201cAdd\u201d button to record it.",

    "question": "What flexibility does the investigations tab provide in ordering diagnostic tests?",
    "expected": "Doctors can order tests by group, profile, or individual selection. They can also specify scheduling, priority, location, and remarks for each test. This flexibility ensures diagnostic orders are tailored to clinical needs and available resources.",
    "answer": "The Investigations/Radiology Tab lets doctors order diagnostic tests in a highly flexible way. They can select tests individually by choosing a test type (All, Investigations or Radiology), searching by name and adding any number of items, or they can use predefined groups and profiles that bundle related parameters such as a Complete Blood Picture or a Lipid Profile and add the whole set with a single click. The tab also allows doctors to pick either all tests in a group or only selected ones before confirming the order. This combination of individual selection, group/profile ordering, and searchable filters gives clinicians full control over which investigations are prescribed.",

    "question": "Why is the 'Other Diagnosis' option useful in the OPD system?",
    "expected": "If a doctor cannot find the required condition in ICD-10 or SNOMED CT lists, they can manually record it under 'Other Diagnosis.' This ensures that all clinical findings are captured, even if not part of standard taxonomies. It balances standardization with flexibility for unique or rare conditions.",
    "answer": "The \u2018Other Diagnosis\u2019 option lets doctors record a diagnosis that is not available in the standard ICD\u201110 or SNOMED\u2011CT lists. By expanding a tab with a free\u2011text box, it provides flexibility to capture uncommon, newly emerging, or institution\u2011specific conditions. This ensures that the patient\u2019s record remains complete and accurate even when the predefined list is insufficient. Once entered, the doctor can add the custom diagnosis to the prescription with a single click.",
