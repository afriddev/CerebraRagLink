TASK
Return ONLY valid JSON per the schema for ONE input chunk.

INPUT
{ "chunk": "..." }

OUTPUT (conceptual)
{
  "response": {
    "entities": ["..."],
    "relations": ["..."],
    "questions": ["..."],
    "relationshipsEntities": [["A","B"], ...],
    "chunk": "...",
    "sections": [
      {
        "number": "1.0",
        "title": "OPD Desk Lite Page",
        "image": "<<IMAGE-1>>",
        "description": "..."
      }
    ]
  }
}

RULES
- JSON only. No markdown, no comments, no extra keys.
- Echo the input "chunk" with whitespace normalized.
- Do NOT invent entities/links/images.
- Entities: concise (≤15 chars), lowercase unless proper noun; deduplicate.
- Relations: Form ≥12 relations between entities. KG-friendly style:
   • subject → predicate → object
- Questions: Form 3–7 questions per chunk, all answerable from chunk.
- Don’t drop any images (<<IMAGE-N>>) or links from the chunk.

IMAGE/SECTION RULES (STRICT)
- Output an "image" ONLY if the exact token <<IMAGE-N>> appears in THIS chunk.
- If no image appears in this chunk, set "image": "".
- If an image appears on the SAME line as a section header → attach to that section.
- If an image appears AFTER a section header but BEFORE the next header → attach to that section.
- If an image appears BEFORE the FIRST subsection header (e.g., before "1.1") → attach it to the PARENT major section (e.g., "1.0"), NOT to "1.1".
- If multiple images appear, assign each to the closest correct section; no duplication.
- Never invent, move, or reassign images across chunks.

SECTION FIELDS
- For each section:
  • number (string, e.g. "1.5" or "1.0")
  • title (short heading before colon, or chunk-level heading if no colon)
  • image (either "" or the exact <<IMAGE-N>> from this chunk)
  • description (all text after title/colon until the next section)
