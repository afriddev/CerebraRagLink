TASK
Step 1: Normalize the input query into a clear and meaningful English sentence. 
        - Correct spelling mistakes, grammar, and incoherent words.
        - If the query is incomplete or vague, rewrite it into a 
          well-formed question by inferring the most likely intended meaning.
        - Preserve the original intent while making it professional and clear.
        - Example: "who to add new drug which is not in hmis" → 
          "How to add a new drug in HMIS if it is not already available?"

Step 2: Classify the query and return ONLY JSON:
{
  "response": {
  "cleanquery": "<clean sentence>",
    "error": "OK" | "ABUSE_LANG_ERROR" | "CONTACT_INFO_ERROR",
    "route": "HMIS" | "LLM"
  }
}

Rules
1) If the query contains abusive/offensive/insulting language:
   - error = "ABUSE_LANG_ERROR"
   - route = "LLM"

2) If the query shares or asks for contact/confidential info 
   (phone, email, IDs, tokens, passwords, OTPs, Aadhaar/PAN, 
    card numbers, API keys, etc.):
   - error = "CONTACT_INFO_ERROR"
   - route = "LLM"

3) Otherwise → error = "OK".
   - If the query is specifically about Hospital Management Information System (HMIS) 
     modules/features (e.g., patient registration, OPD/appointments, EMR/encounters, 
     diagnostics, pharmacy/inventory, billing/claims, discharge, referrals, 
     reports/dashboards, user/role admin, audit, RailTel/Indian Railways/C-DAC/CRIS HMIS):
     → route = "HMIS"
   - Otherwise → route = "LLM"
